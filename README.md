# Daily Carbon Footprint Calculator

## Description
This project seeks to help the user keep track of their carbon footprint by streamlining carbon footprint calculations and personal goal setting. The user only needs to set up their basic information once and log their daily activities within a few seconds each day to have their carbon footprint calculated, compared to their selected carbon footprint goals, and their process recorded on an accessible calendar.
